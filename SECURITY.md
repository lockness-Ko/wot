## Reporting a Vulnerability

Flick me a DM on discord at `lockness Ko#7954`

Almost any type of vulnerability is excepted, except for these:
 - Anything below a 2 on the CVSS table (unless I get people to help patch these and more contributors, otherwise it is too much work for me to chase small things)
